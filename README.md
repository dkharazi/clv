# clv

In most cases, customer lifetime value (or CLV) represents how much a customer is worth (maybe in USD) over their entire lifetime with the company. Some companies will assign a single, average value to represent the CLV of all of their customers. By doing this, those companies are assuming every customer behaves and is worth the same.

Typically, companies will make sure their cost of acquiring a customer (or CAC) is less than that customer's lifetime value. For example, a company could say *"I know the CLV of each customer for my business is $100, so that's the most I can spend to acquire them."* However, the obvious reasons for why this statement is wrong include the following:
- Since customers behave differently, not all customers should have the same CLV
- Since CLV is a forward-looking estimate, we should include confidence intervals for our CLV estimates
- Since current sales have already happened, we should be interested in the future spend of a customer
- Since CLV is an estimate, we should be estimating the future cost of acquiring a customer too

# Applications of CLV

There are many use-cases for CLV to be used across any type of business. The following are only a few use-cases that can provide immediate impact to a company:
- More effective reporting
- More meaningful segmentation
- More accurate testing
- More effective customer targeting for premium offerings and loyalty programs
